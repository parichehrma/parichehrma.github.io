# Data Science Projects:
## Welcome

This repository presents a sampling of data science projects including exploratory data analysis, A/B testing, supervised and unsupervised learning models to make predictions. All datasets were taken from Kaggle and other resources. In each project, I applied exploratory data analysis and different learning models on different feature sets, evaluated models and chose the best one which I recommended as the best model to solve the research question. Below is a short explanation of each of the projects in my portfolio: 

## [Coronavirus (covid_19):](https://github.com/parichehrma/PariMa.github.io./blob/master/Capstone%20Final%20about%20%20covid19.ipynb)

### Overview: 
The focus of this project is to analyze COVID-19 and significant risk factors associated with this virus. It is also to find rates for confirmed cases or deaths and make predictions by different machine learning methods.

### Techniques Used:
I used exploratory data analysis(EDA), A/B testing, dimensional reduction, some supervised models to solve classification problems including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classification as well as some Unsupervised learning (clustering) including Kmeans, Hierarchical Clustering, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBSCAN) and Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). I also applied some of these models with pyspark.
 
## [Predicting Attack for Network Intrusion Detection](https://github.com/parichehrma/PariMa.github.io./blob/master/Capstone%20of%20Supervised%20Learning%20final.ipynb)

### Overview:
Exploring data for analysing Network Intrusion Detection Attack and perform anomaly detection.

### Techniques Used:
EDA, Feature Engineering likes one-hot, Applying PCA, A/B testing, various supervised models to solve classification problems including Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier models, optimizing models by Scale and GridSearch. 

## [Customer Segmentation Based On Their Credit Card Usage Behavior](https://github.com/parichehrma/PariMa.github.io./blob/master/Capstone%20of%20Unsupervised%20learning1.ipynb)

### Overview:
Customer Segmentation by using customer behaviors in order to define a proper marketing strategy.

### Techniques Used:
Applying various dimensional reduction (PCA, TSNE, UMAP), Various unsupervised(clustering) models such as KMean, Hierarchical Clustering, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

## [Google Play Store:](https://github.com/parichehrma/PariMa.github.io./blob/master/Capstone%202%20Google%20Play%20Store%20Apps_KN_20191112.ipynb)

### Overview:
Exploring data for analysing Google PlayStore and comparing different aspects of it. Also evaluated this hyphothesis: "Paid apps have a higher install rate compared to the free apps".

### Techniques Used:
I used exploratory data analysis(EDA) including data cleaning, visualized the dataset with different plots and A/B testing.

## [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://github.com/parichehrma/PariMa.github.io./blob/master/Capstone_1_Trending%20YouTube%20Video%20Statistics.ipynb)

### Overview:
Attempting to analyze YouTube trending videos dataset and compared different aspects of them.

### Techniques Used:
I used exploratory data analysis(EDA), A/B testing.
